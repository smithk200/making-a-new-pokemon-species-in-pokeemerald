# making-a-new-pokemon-species-in-pokeemerald
Works with Python 2.7 and IDLE.
I used Python 2.7 growing up, this is why.
This is intended to be compatible with rhh's pokeemerald-expansion, for making a new pokemon species.

## How to use
Make  a list in Python by doing this: species = []. If you want to add a new Pokemon species in the list so the program will generate it, put the species name in quotes. (I will use the Quaxly line as an example.)
So the list will look like this: species = ['Quaxly']

If you want to add a new Pokemon species to this, just add a comma and then type the new species name in quotes, like this: species = ['Quaxly','Quaxwell']. Add a comma before each entry in the list.

Then, simply run "all_together(species)" either at the end of the program, or, alternatively, run the program and then run "all_together(species)"! It should output out all your text for you! (Note: you WILL have to edit some things manually, such as the base stats and the learnsets.)

Then just copy and paste the text into the corresponding file, and you should be all set! (Note: You will have to provide the graphics and the cries on your own.)
